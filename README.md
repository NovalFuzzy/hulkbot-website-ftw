# Hulkbot Website FOR. THE. WIN!
At least that's what [NovalFuzzy](https://github.com/NovalFuzzy) said when he created the repo. :P
## No, but seriously. Hulkbot is expanding every day, and is getting bigger and bigger. We ***seriously*** need a web panel for this big guy.
If you want to help contribute with that, click [here](https://github.com/FHGDev/JSHulkbot/blob/gh-pages/)
## Also, I'm going to need money to keep hosting this bot past my current host's limit... Which that means my bot is going to be down for a couple days per month.
I don't want you guys to have to go without the awesomeness in the form of javascript called Hulkbot...
So, my patreon is [here](https://patreon.com/fhg)...
## So... Why would you want to donate... If you don't get anything...
Well you do... Just not yet. I'm still working on the premium module, and I've got a pretty good idea for what I'm going to do with it.
With premium, you can listen to music in your server, use DM commands, have a personal logger on who gets banned/kicked in your discord and more!
So I'm coming up with some pretty coolio stuff... For only $5 a month! Pretty chill huh?
